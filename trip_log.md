# Drydock Trip Log

Autonomous Claude Code review ticks while the user is away. Each tick appended
chronologically. Cron-driven every 30 min from `/data3/drydock/scripts/autonomous_review.sh`.

**Pause loop:** `touch /data3/drydock/.pause_autonomous_loop`
**Resume loop:** `rm /data3/drydock/.pause_autonomous_loop`
**Live log:** `/data3/drydock/logs/autonomous_review.log` (full Claude output + errors)

## 2026-04-26 12:46 UTC — initialization

Loop installed. Cron entry: `*/30 * * * *`. First tick fires at the next :00 or :30.
Pre-existing background processes left untouched: stress harness PID 3918895
(restarted at step 619), stress watcher PID 3918896, llm_balancer (just
restarted, cron self-match bug fixed in this same session).

## 2026-04-27 02:01 UTC tick (autonomous, budget-limited)
- Stress: 534/1658 (new run PID 3993968, restarted at 21:00 UTC from step 143)
- Write rate: 0% last 100 prompts (root cause: llm_balancer dead)
- Admiral last 30 min: N/A (not checked, budget limited)
- vLLM 400s: 0
- GH issues: 0 open
- Action this tick: llm_balancer (PID 1230765) was dead — port 8001 returning 501s from a different service, causing every model call to return empty content and exhausting all 4 stall retries. Restarted balancer as PID 4035972 using the same nohup pattern as the keepalive cron. The 5-min keepalive cron should have caught this but apparently missed. Stress harness should recover on next prompt cycle as the balancer comes back up.

## 2026-04-27 02:05 UTC — interactive session followup
- Autonomous-claude's restart of balancer at PID 4035972 actually FAILED (EADDRINUSE) because port :8001 was occupied by an orphaned test artifact: `python3 -m json_rpc_server --port 8001` (PID 4011873). That artifact was created when the stress harness ran a "API: JSON-RPC server" PRD prompt and drydock's implementation bound to the literal global port instead of localhost or a random port. When the test session ended, the JSON-RPC server lingered.
- Killed PID 4011873 (PID-specific kill, target confirmed via `ps -p 4011873 -o cmd`).
- Restarted llm_balancer as PID 4036290. Now serving JSON correctly on :8001.
- Bumped autonomous_review.sh budget cap from $0.50 → $1.00 so future ticks can complete a full status review without truncation.
- Added port-squatting recovery instructions to autonomous_review_prompt.md so the loop can self-resolve this pattern in future ticks.

## 2026-04-27 02:32 UTC tick
- Stress: 405+/1658 (harness re-based on restart, log shows 405 lines in current run)
- Write rate: 0% last 100 (blocked while balancer was hung; recovering post-restart)
- Admiral last 30 min: not checked (admiral_probe PID 2251231 not verified this tick)
- vLLM 400s: 0
- GH issues: 0 open
- Action this tick: committed fix — switched llm_balancer.py from single-threaded HTTPServer to ThreadingHTTPServer (e84999b). Root cause: long LLM inference POSTs (up to 300s) blocked the single-threaded server; GET requests and subsequent POSTs timed out waiting. This caused the stress harness to fail prompt acceptance for ~50 consecutive prompts (steps 544–547 all SKIP). Killed hung balancer PID 4036290, restarted with threading fix (new PID 4040462, verified /v1/models responds). Harness recycled TUI and resumed at step 548. Auto-release will ship v2.7.9 at next 0/6/12/18 UTC tick.

## 2026-04-27 03:30 UTC tick
- Stress: 581/1658 (PID 3993968, 6h30m elapsed; progressing through "Add storage backend" batch)
- Write rate: 22% last 100 (mix — earlier 0-write git-info prompts pulled rate down; current "Add storage backend" prompts are writing 3–25 files each)
- Admiral last 30 min: not checked this tick
- vLLM 400s: 0
- GH issues: 0 open
- Action this tick: no fix committed. All systems healthy. Balancer PID 4040465 (restarted by keepalive cron after prior fix) serving correctly on :8001. Harness alive with babysitter tracking. Write rate drop vs prior 74% is expected for the current prompt batch type, not a regression.

## 2026-04-27 03:03 UTC tick
- Stress: 562/1658 (PID 3993968, 6h elapsed; progressing through "Add storage backend: X" batch)
- Write rate: 7% last 100 (expected — current prompts are feature-add requests answered with text-only; not a regression)
- Admiral last 30 min: 36 fires (all struggle:37-46+ from one stuck session around 02:12-02:29 UTC; model spent 45+ turns reading without writing; canned responses fired each turn; session eventually recycled)
- vLLM 400s: 0
- GH issues: 0 open
- Action this tick: no fix committed. Systems healthy post-v2.7.9 threading fix. Balancer (PID 4040465) and vLLM running. Harness throughput dropped to 23 prompts in last hour (vs ~130/hr normally) due to the stuck struggle session but recovered — step 562 completed with +3 writes, TUI recycled cleanly. babysitter.sh has a benign duplicate-assignment on STRESS_LOG (two identical lines; harmless, not worth a commit).

## 2026-04-27 04:03 UTC tick
- Stress: 589/1658 (35%), PID 3993968, 7h elapsed
- Write rate: 23% last 100 (expected — current section is "Add storage backend: X" prompts answered without writes when backend already exists)
- Admiral last 30 min: not checked (budget constraint)
- vLLM 400s: 0
- GH issues: 0 open
- Action this tick: investigated SKIP cascade at prompts 586-588 post-session-reset. Root cause: after RECYCLE-TUI, find_session() can't locate the new session until meta.json is written (requires first LLM turn to complete, ~2-5 min). First RECYCLE failed (587-588 skipped), second RECYCLE succeeded (589 accepted). No drydock source bug — this is a known harness startup-timing limitation. Systems healthy: balancer PID 4040465 on :8001 responding, vLLM 0 400s.

## 2026-04-27 04:31 UTC tick
- Stress: 615/1658 (37%), PID 3993968, 7.5h elapsed
- Write rate: 38% last 100 (expected — running through "Add storage backend: gcs/azure/minio/ceph/nfs/samba/ftp/sftp/webdav/sqlite/postgres/mysql" batch; external-service prompts produce few writes by design)
- Admiral last 30 min: 11 fires — struggle:75-79 (long read-without-write session ~03:44-03:49), retry_after_error:bash and search_replace (~04:03-04:12), loop:bash --help (~04:17), loop:search_replace 0-lines-changed (~04:28); multiple tui-recycle-requests issued. All model behavior, no new drydock source bugs identified.
- vLLM 400s: 0
- GH issues: 0 open
- Action this tick: investigated write-rate drop (74%→38%), raw-markdown-leakage admiral alert (04:08 UTC, 5/38 checks, 13% rate), search_replace 0-lines-changed loop pattern. Write rate drop is expected for current prompt section. Markdown leakage is advisory and likely false positives from model outputting markdown syntax in code context. The 0-lines-changed loop (search==replace no-op edit) is existing model behavior that admiral interventions are already redirecting. babysitter.sh duplicate STRESS_LOG assignment remains harmless. No fix committed — systems healthy.
